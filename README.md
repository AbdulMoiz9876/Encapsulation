# Encapsulation
In common terms, Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. 
In object-oriented programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.
Encapsulation also leads to data abstraction or hiding. 
Using Encapsulation also hides the data. In the previous example, the data of any of the sections like sales, finance, or accounts are hidden from any other area.
